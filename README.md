# Renshuu Kata 練習型

Learn japanese through form and practice.

## What?

This project aims to be a collection of (TUI) tool for learners of the Japanese language.

Each independent app focuses on a specific task, that need to be repeated till mastered 
(hence the name).

In the future, I'd like to provide a "main" app that connects, organises and keeps track
of all your progress, etc.

I'm starting with **Go** now, but I may switch to other language later lol.


Hope it will be useful!
